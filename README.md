# Notes

`workbook.ipynb` contains the code used to preprocess data, create the model architectures, train the models and visualize their outputs.

`membership_inference_attacks.ipynb` contains the code used to run membership inference attacks and obtain AUC values for the models generated by `workbook.ipynb`

The folders contain the weights for some of the models that I trained (to include them all would be including hundreds of hdf5 files). The ones here are ones that I used in my results table or selected as "the best" after hyperparameter experimentation:

`initial_trained_model`: intially trained model
`retain_set_trained_model`: retrained model
`finetune_retain_set`: finetuned model
`pruned`: pruned models and pruned then finetuned model
`student-teacher-no-prune`: models trained with student teacher framework
`student-teacher-prune`: pruned models trained with student teacher framework
